# Project Name

This repository contains the code and CI/CD setup for deploying the `Project Name` application using GitHub Actions. This guide outlines how to set up the pipeline, trigger builds, run tests, and deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (or any other dependencies specific to your project)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional for easier management)

## CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD process includes the following steps:

1. **Code Build**: Compiling and preparing your application.
2. **Unit Tests**: Running unit tests to ensure code quality.
3. **Linting**: Running code linting tools (optional).
4. **Build Docker Image**: Containerizing the application for deployment.
5. **Push to Docker Registry**: Uploading the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., DockerHub).
6. **Deployment**: Deploying the application to a server or cloud environment (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).

### GitHub Actions Workflow File

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/main.yml` and is triggered on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
